# Note that I'm ignoring pvaPy's real versioning, instead opting to pick the
# version number associated with a particular EPICS-CPP release.
# This is a separate build because epics-v4 takes a while to compile and pvaPy
# should be be linked to a numpy release at build.

  # Full source to make sure we get the associated release of pvaPy

  # Include patches for syntax change at boost 1.63
  # This is the release that incorporates boost numpy into the main package
  # It's also the only way I found to get boost numpy from conda-forge
  # Not using numpy for now because our python stack uses an older boost
