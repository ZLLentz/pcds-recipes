# pcds-recipes
Collection of conda recipes for PCDS software.

Python packages should, in general, contain working conda recipes within the project for proper versioning. This repository is then for packages that don't include recipes but don't belong on conda-forge and for non-python packages for which we must write a custom recipe.
