# pcds-recipes
Collection of conda recipes for PCDS software at LCLS.

Python packages should, in general, contain working conda recipes within the project for proper versioning. This repository is then for packages that don't include recipes but don't belong on conda-forge and for non-python packages for which we must write a custom recipe. The packages here generally won't have much use outside of LCLS's EPICS-centric controls environment.
