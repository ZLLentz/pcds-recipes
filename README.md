# pcds-recipes
Collection of conda recipes for PCDS software at LCLS.

This repository is for conda recipes for packages that don't automatically
upload to the pcds-tag channel, but also can't be found on conda-forge or
in defaults. These tend to be community packages like EPICS, packages from
other groups at SLAC, and packages that we need to patch for some reason or
another.
